# Catan Dice Roller

You can try this app out [here](https://hereismy.website/catan-dice-roller/)

After my cat knocked one of my dice under the fridge, I built this dice-rolling app to use while playing "The Settlers of Catan." I ended up preferring using it over actual dice, because:

- it keeps track of whose turn it is;
- it shows the percentages of each roll, helping you strategize somewhat; and
- it eliminates the possiblity of any argument about how "8 was never rolled," which inevitably happens at the end of every game of Catan.

This was built with vanilla JavaScript. It works on mobile but looks best on desktop.
